## Hi, there!
I'm a self-proclaimed nerd in the whimsical world of üõ°Ô∏è cybersecurity, tirelessly working to keep digital boogeymen away from our critical infrastructures. Picture me as the person with a horrible mohawk co-leading the DEF CON Red Team Village. I also play chair in the court of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard technical committee, among several other industry efforts. I am in the OASIS Open board of directors.

Collaboration? You bet! I work with an entourage of groups, like the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), ISACs, and law enforcement agencies, as we huddle together like a digital Avengers team to save the world, one secured network at a time. Well, at least that's the goal.

I have a passion for AI, ethical hacking, vulnerability research, and incident response. I help organizations pull up their digital socks and dodge those pesky threats that keep popping up like a game of cybersecurity whack-a-mole. I've played a role in patching up the cyber defenses of all sorts of folks, from buttoned-up business tycoons and bespectacled academics to super-serious government agencies.

My claim to fame? More than twenty five books, video courses, white papers, and tech articles where I bore people about all things cyber. At Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), I'm a principal engineer, leading a talented team of digital Sherlock Holmeses while mentoring the cyber Padawans of tomorrow. My life's mission? Ensuring the only cookies üç™ you need to worry about are the ones in your jar and not in your browser. 

Remember, in this wild world of zeroes and ones, always keep your code clean üíª, your tech strong, and your coffee stronger!
